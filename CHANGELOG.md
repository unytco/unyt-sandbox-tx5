## [0.20.0]

### Changed

- new hash space, with new UI updates based on team testing

## [0.19.0]

### Added

- **Role-Based Input Rules in SmartAgreements:** `SmartAgreement` input rules now reference roles defined in the `CodeTemplate`, ensuring a clear and verifiable link between the two. This change streamlines validation by delegating role expectation management to the `CodeTemplate`. [#169](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/169)
- **Role Definitions in `CodeTemplate`:** The `agreement_definition_input` in `CodeTemplate` now defines roles and their `consumed_link` expectation. This centralizes role management, simplifying `SmartAgreement` validation. [#169](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/169)
- **Validation for `hdi_call` Inputs in SAVED:** `SAVED` now validates that inputs using `hdi_call` collect the correct values, improving data integrity and ensuring that `hdi_call` operations are properly validated.
- **Enhanced Validation for `unyt_allocation` in SAVED:** `SAVED` now validates that the source of a `unyt_allocation` is not reused, preventing duplicate spending and ensuring that all allocations are unique.[#169](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/169)
- CodeTemplateExt and SmartAgreementExt returns a vec of tags [#171](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/171)
- `ignore_notification` zome call to dismiss transaction notifications [#172](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/172)
- Simple transaction signaling to use `post_commit` hook, providing more reliable and detailed real-time updates to all parties involved in a transaction. [#173](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/173)
- DNA: `get_all_my_smart_agreements` added to get smart_agreements created by this agent itself [#176](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/176)
- `SmartAgreementExt` updated to return version [#176](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/176)
- DNA: added endpoint to get status of a tx or agreement based on hash [#177](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/177)

### Changed

- **Breaking Change:** `SmartAgreement` no longer defines its own role expectations and instead relies on the `CodeTemplate` to manage them. This change simplifies the `SmartAgreement` structure and centralizes role management.[#169](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/169)
- **Refined `hdi_call` Support:** `SmartAgreement` input rules now exclusively support `hdi_calls` to ensure all operations can be validated on the DHT. This improves security and data consistency.
- `create_smart_agreement` and `create_code_template` payloads updated to not expect a separate `tag` parameter. The `tags` are now included in the `SmartAgreement` and `CodeTemplate` structs. [#174](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/174)
- Tags are now returned as `TagFilter` objects instead of strings, providing more structured data. [#174](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/174)
- When updating `CodeTemplate` or `SmartAgreement` tags, old tags are removed and new tags are added, ensuring the entry's tags are always up-to-date. [#174](https://github.com/unytco/unyt/pull/174)
- updated get_code_templates_by_tags to get_code_templates_by_folder
- updated get_all_agents_code_templates to get_my_code_templates
