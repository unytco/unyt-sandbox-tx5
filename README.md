## Intro

Unyt is a Holochain based application for creating p2p credit and payment systems with Smart Agreement functionality.

This release is focused on highlighting Unyt's approach to Smart Agreements.

Though they sound similar to Blockchain Smart Contracts, Unyt's Smart Agreements work a little differently and therefore open up some different possibilities.

To dive into more details on Smart Agreements, check out:
- [The Smart Agreement Overview](./testing_docs/5_0_Smart_Agreement_Release.md)
- [Intro to Creating Smart Agreements](./testing_docs/4_1_intro_to_smart_agreements.md)
- [Smart Agreements Library](https://github.com/unytco/smart_agreement_library)
- [Unyt Dictionary](./testing_docs/4_2_unyt-dictionary.md)


## Invitation to Play

Welcome to Unyt. We invite you to kick the tires a bit, try out a Smart Agreement or two and maybe even try creating your own.

[Share your address](https://forms.gle/sbCFUuv8sGyYhnc97) with others and find theirs as well in the [Address Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gusOPtLVpT2RCDP7DRhVX39OEE-XAv26pnkPrwZbqzM/edit?gid=2043153663#gid=2043153663).

Feel free to join the conversation in the Unyt Thread on the [Holochain DEV.HC Discord](https://discord.com/invite/k55DS5dmPH).

How to give yourself access? 
1. Go to the '#👤・5・select-a-role'' Channel
2. Assign yourself the ''Access to: Projects'' role 
3. In the category ''Projects'' go to the channel called ''Unyt"

For those that want to go a bit deeper, we'd like you to test the usability of custom Smart Agreement configurations and system features.

* create and test service units relevant to your network.
* aggregate receives via a Smart Agreement RAVE (e.g. process bulk invoices via a log collector with a single payment)
* aggregate sends via a Smart Agreement RAVE (e.g. collection of transaction fees)


## Downloads 

Select from two versions of apps to download. 
1. The **Full-Arc** verson holds a full copy of the DHT locally, synchronizing all data being published. 
2. The **Zero-Arc** version is lighter weight to run (which will be good for mobile phones, for example) because only holds your own history, and caches some other network data, but some actions will be slower because you'll need to fetch data from peers on the network.

All available versions can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/unytco/unyt-sandbox-tx5/releases/)

Once installed, the Unyt software will run locally on your device and connect with others also running the software to operate as a peer-to-peer application.

## Setup

Note: In Mac, because you downloaded the software directly and not through Apple's App Store, you may need to open the System Settings and go to Privacy and Security, scroll down to Security and give Unyt permission to run.

If you want to delete everything and start over with a new account, check out [Starting Fresh](./testing_docs/starting_fresh.md)


When you open Unyt on your operating system for the first time, it will create a set of public and private keys for you that you can use to interact with others. These are stored in a private keystore (Lair) on your own machine and are used during future uses. In Unyt we often refer to this public key as "your address" as it is how others can refer to you when sending, receiving or authorizing you to perform particular roles.
