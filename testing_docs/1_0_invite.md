### Phase 5: Playing with Smart Agreements

Start: October 8, 2025
Duration: 2 weeks
Version: 0.40.0

#### Overview
Welcome to Unyt. We invite you to kick the tires a bit, try out a Smart Agreement or two and maybe even try creating your own.

[Share your address](https://forms.gle/sbCFUuv8sGyYhnc97) with others and find theirs as well in the [Address Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gusOPtLVpT2RCDP7DRhVX39OEE-XAv26pnkPrwZbqzM/edit?gid=2043153663#gid=2043153663).

For those that want to go a bit deeper, we'd like you to test the usability of custom Smart Agreement configurations and system features.

* create and test service units relevant to your network.
* aggregate receives via a Smart Agreement RAVE (e.g. process bulk invoices via a log collector with a single payment)
